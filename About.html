        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>This is the About page of my GitHub Pages .</p>
        <p>I am an Assistant Professor of Economics at Waseda University, Tokyo, Japan. Previously, I taught and researched at the Meiji Gakuin University in Japan, the Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD) in Bangladesh, the Overseas Development Institute (ODI) in the UK, and several other research organizations.</p>

<p>My primary research interests are labor economics, development economics, microeconomics, and empirical and applied economics. I am also interested in agricultural economics, public economics, and macroeconomics. My earlier research covered multiple issues, including women`s economic contribution and empowerment, agricultural economics and food safety, and performances of macroeconomic, health, and education indicators. I am available for research and academic collaboration.</p> 

<p>I completed PhD in Development Economics at the National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies and my PhD research focus was labor economics, labor market institutions, policies, and outcomes. The research approach was mainly empirical microanalysis, also a life cycle model. Data used in my PhD projects were labor force surveys, population censuses, business censuses, web scrapping, and an online primary survey. I completed an MSc in Economics from Queen Mary University of London in the UK, and a BSS in Economics from Jagannath University in Bangladesh. I mainly use R, Stata, and LaTex for data analysis, writing, and teaching. I infrequently use Python, MATLAB, MS Office, and Eviews packages.</p>

<p>I have wide experience of being involved in various voluntary activities to increase social goods stock, some of them are mentoring students, helping in scholarship and admission preparation, leading student organizations, funds and necessary goods collection for vulnerable, tree plantation, anti-drug and against sexual harassment activities, blood donation, cleaning in Bangladesh, UK, and Japan.</p>

<p>Knowledge profession and active voluntarism are my passions. I enjoy reading, talking and sharing thoughts, walking, hiking, and visiting culture and history-marking places.</p>
