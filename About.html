            <p>
                I am an Assistant Professor of Economics in the Faculty of Political Science and Economics at <a href="https://www.waseda.jp/fpse/faculty-en/2024/04/01/2454/" target="_blank">Waseda University</a>, Tokyo, Japan. Previously, I taught at Meiji Gakuin University and held research positions at the Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD) in Bangladesh, the Overseas Development Institute (ODI) in the UK, and other organizations.
            </p>
            <p>
                My research interests include labor economics, development economics, microeconomics, and applied economics. I am also passionate about agricultural and public economics, as well as macroeconomics. My work spans topics such as womenâ€™s economic empowerment, food safety, and macroeconomic, health, and education indicators.
            </p>
            <p>
                Currently, I am involved in several projects on migration, labor markets, and intergenerational transmission. I teach public economics, data and econometric methods, development economics, and labor economics.
            </p>
            <p>
                My academic journey includes a PhD in Development Economics from the <a href="https://grips.repo.nii.ac.jp/records/2000048" target="_blank">National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies (GRIPS)</a>, Tokyo, Japan, an MSc in Economics from <a href="https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/91816/1/MPRA_paper_91816.pdf" target="_blank">Queen Mary University of London</a>, UK, and a BSS in Economics from Jagannath University, Bangladesh.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am proficient in R, Stata, and LaTeX, and occasionally use Python, MATLAB, MS Office, and Eviews for research and teaching.
            </p>
            <p>
                Beyond academia, I am actively involved in voluntary activities such as mentoring, scholarship guidance, leading student organizations, fundraising, tree plantation, anti-drug and anti-harassment initiatives, blood donation, and community cleaning in Bangladesh, UK, and Japan.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am passionate about knowledge sharing and voluntarism. I enjoy reading, engaging in discussions, walking, hiking, and exploring places of cultural and historical significance.
