        <h2>Short bio</h2>
        <p>
            I am an Assistant Professor of Economics at Waseda University, Tokyo, Japan. 
            Previously, I taught at the Meiji Gakuin University in Japan. I was a researcher at the Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD) in Bangladesh, 
            the Overseas Development Institute (ODI) in the UK, and several other research organizations.
            I am available for research and academic collaboration.
        </p>
        <p>
            Currently, I am involved in projects on migration, labor markets, and intergenerational transmission. 
            I teach public economics, data and econometric methods, development economics, and labor economics.
        </p>
        <p>
            My primary research interests are labor economics, development economics, microeconomics, and empirical and applied economics. 
            I am also interested in public economics, agricultural economics, and macroeconomics. 
        </p>
        <p>
            My earlier research covered multiple issues, including women`s economic contribution and empowerment, Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs),
            agricultural economics and food safety, and performances of macroeconomic, health, and education indicators. 
        </p>
        <p>
            My PhD research focus was labor economics, labor market institutions, policies, and outcomes. 
            The research approach was mainly empirical microanalysis, also a life cycle model was designed. 
            Data used in my studies were labor force surveys, population censuses, business censuses, web scraping, and an online primary survey. 
            In the MSc dissertation, I used Bayesian VAR to analyse macroeconomic and financial variables in the UK.  
            I mainly use R, Stata, and LaTex for data analysis, writing, and teaching. I infrequently use Python, MATLAB, MS Office, and Eviews packages.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have wide experience in being involved in various voluntary activities to increase social goods stock. 
            Some of my voluntary and service to the profession include reviewing research and academic materials, mentoring students, 
            helping in scholarship and admission preparation, leading student organizations, funds and necessary goods collection for vulnerable, 
            tree plantation, anti-drug and against sexual harassment activities, blood donation, cleaning in Bangladesh, UK, and Japan.
        </p>
        <p>
            Knowledge profession and active voluntarism are my passions. 
            I enjoy reading, talking and sharing thoughts, walking, hiking, and visiting culture and history-marking places.
